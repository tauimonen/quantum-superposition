# Quantum Measurement Simulation

This project provides a simulation framework for analyzing quantum measurements using two main classes:

1. **QuantumEntanglementAnalyzer**: Simulates the behavior of entangled photon pairs, including state initialization, measurement probabilities, and state collapse upon observation.
2. **QuantumQubitAnalyzer**: Models the measurement of a single quantum qubit's polarization state and its probabilistic collapse based on quantum mechanics principles.

## Features
- **Quantum State Representation**: Uses amplitudes to define quantum states.
- **Measurement Simulation**: Implements quantum measurements and collapses states accordingly.
- **Probability Computation**: Calculates the probabilities of different measurement outcomes.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Collects and analyzes results over multiple measurements.

## Class Overview

### QuantumEntanglementAnalyzer

#### Methods:
- `setAngles(double theta1, double theta2)`: Sets measurement angles for both photons.
- `reportProbabilities()`: Computes and prints probabilities of different outcomes.
- `measure()`: Simulates a random measurement and updates the state.

#### Example Usage:
```java
QuantumEntanglementAnalyzer simulation = new QuantumEntanglementAnalyzer(0.707, 0, 0, 0.707);
simulation.setAngles(90, 90);
simulation.reportProbabilities();
```

### QuantumQubitAnalyzer

A photon's polarization is probabilistic when it is measured relative to a specific polarization basis that does not fully align with its original polarization state.

Explanation

### 1. Original Polarization State
If a photon is initially polarized in a horizontal (|H‚ü®) or vertical (|V‚ü®) state, and it is measured in the same polarization basis (horizontal or vertical), the result is deterministic‚Äîthe photon retains its original polarization.

### 2. Measurement at an Angle
If the photon's initial polarization is at some angle Œ∏ relative to the measurement basis, the measurement outcome becomes probabilistic. For example, if a photon is polarized at an angle Œ∏ and is measured in the horizontal (|H‚ü®) and vertical (|V‚ü®) basis, the probability of detecting it in the |H‚ü® state is cos¬≤(Œ∏), and the probability of detecting it in the |V‚ü® state is sin¬≤(Œ∏).

### 3. Quantum Explanation
This probabilistic behavior arises from the principles of quantum mechanics. When a photon's polarization is at an arbitrary angle and is measured in a basis that does not match its original state, the measurement collapses the state into one of the basis states with probabilities determined by Born's rule and the inner product between the state vectors.

## Conclusion
A photon's polarization is probabilistic when the measurement basis differs from its original polarization state. The outcome probabilities follow cos¬≤(Œ∏) and sin¬≤(Œ∏), where Œ∏ is the angle between the original state and the measurement basis.

#### Methods:
- `performMeasurement(double measurementAngle)`: Simulates a qubit polarization measurement and updates the state.

#### Example Usage:
```java
QuantumQubitAnalyzer qubit = new QuantumQubitAnalyzer(90);
boolean result = qubit.performMeasurement(45);
System.out.println("Measurement result: " + result);
```

## Running the Simulation

# üß† Understanding Qubits via Photon Polarization

This explains how qubits are represented using photon polarization, how measurement works at various angles, and how entanglement influences outcomes‚Äîeven after measurement.

##  Qubits as Photon Polarization

In this simulation, **qubits are encoded as the polarization of photons**. That is, the orientation of a photon's electric field vector corresponds to the quantum state.

We define the qubit value based on whether the photon‚Äôs polarization is **aligned** or **anti-aligned** with a **measurement filter**.

---

## Measurement Convention

### Measurement at **90¬∞**

When a polarizer is set at **90 degrees**, the rule is:

- ‚úÖ **Aligned with polarizer** ‚Üí `Qubit = 1`
- ‚ùå **Anti-aligned (orthogonal)** ‚Üí `Qubit = 0`

This is our **reference basis**.

---

### Measurement at **Other Angles**

If the measurement filter is set to another angle (e.g., 0¬∞, 45¬∞, etc.):

- ‚úÖ **Photon aligned with the filter** ‚Üí `1`
- ‚ùå **Photon anti-aligned with the filter** ‚Üí `0`

The outcome still follows the **same rule**, but now "alignment" is judged **relative to the new angle**.

---

## Entanglement & Measurement

When two photons are **entangled**, their polarizations are **quantum-correlated**:

- Measuring one photon **instantly affects** the expected result of the other, even at a distance.
- However, **once a measurement is made**, the entanglement is **broken**.
- Despite this, the **statistical outcomes** of repeated trials **reflect the influence** of the previous entanglement.
